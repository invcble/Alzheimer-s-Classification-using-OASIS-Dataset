## Models and Accuracy

This section provides a detailed look at the performance of various machine learning models on the task of classifying Alzheimer's disease progression using the OASIS dataset. The dataset images were preprocessed and transformed to two different resolutions, namely 64x32 and 128x64, to assess the impact of image resolution on model performance. The performance metrics are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Binary Classification

Binary classification was performed to distinguish between 'Normal' and Alzheimer's affected cases.

- **LDA with PCA**:
  - 64x32: Accuracy = 70.46%
  - 128x64: Accuracy = 77.85%

- **Logistic Regression**:
  - 64x32: Accuracy = 72.92%
  - 128x64: Accuracy = 75.08%

### One vs. One Classification

For more nuanced classification, a one-vs-one approach was adopted.

- **LDA with PCA**:
  - Normal: 75.62% (64x32), 77.47% (128x64)
  - Blur: 73.61% (64x32), 76.08% (128x64)
  - Canny: 66.82% (64x32), 61.27% (128x64)

- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Normal: 81.94% (64x32), 82.72% (128x64)
  - Blur: 80.86% (64x32), 81.79% (128x64)
  - Canny: 72.99% (64x32), 77.47% (128x64)

### Multi-Class Classification

Multi-class classification aimed to categorize the stages of Alzheimer's disease progression.

- **Multi-class LDA with PCA**:
  - Normal: 46.54% (64x32), 49.00% (128x64)
  - Blur: 45.01% (64x32), 47.93% (128x64)
  - Canny: 47.00% (64x32), 48.69% (128x64)

- **Na√Øve Bayes**:
  - Normal: 66.51% (64x32), 66.51% (128x64)
  - Blur: 68.36% (64x32), 69.12% (128x64)
  - Canny: 59.75% (64x32), 59.60% (128x64)

- **KNN**:
  - Normal: 62.06% (64x32), 62.21% (128x64)
  - Blur: 61.60% (64x32), 62.06% (128x64)
  - Canny: 76.04% (64x32), 78.03% (128x64)

### Ensemble Model Performance

An ensemble approach was utilized to combine the strengths of the individual models, leading to improved overall performance.

- **64x32 Resolution**:
  - Accuracy: 82.72%
  - Precision: 83.57%
  - Recall: 82.72%
  - F1-score: 83.14%

- **128x64 Resolution**:
  - Accuracy: 83.18%
  - Precision: 83.77%
  - Recall: 83.18%
  - F1-score: 83.48%

These results demonstrate the viability of using machine learning models to classify Alzheimer's progression with varying levels of accuracy depending on the model and image resolution used. The ensemble method, in particular, shows promise for improving classification performance in this domain.
